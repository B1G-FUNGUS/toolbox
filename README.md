# Description

A compilation of general purpose C libraries.

# TODO

- add vectors with buffers

- add automatic vectors that don't have to be freed (?)
	- having vectors store there elements on the stack is generally a bad
	  idea, but it would be cool (though not really useful, I suspect) to
	  have vectors which are automatically freed

- resizing command for vectors

- make clargs use vectors

- fix `//TODO`'s


# Known Issues
